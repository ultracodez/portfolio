					Senior Fullstack Software Engineer from the U.S.A.

				<p className="mt-8">
					As a passionate front-end developer, I create amazing websites and web
					apps to make the internet a better place. I am an advocate for web
					performance and accessibility as well as a JAMstack enthusiast with
					experience in serverless technologies.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					I am 31 years old and have been a web developer for as long as I can
					think. The technologies I work with are JavaScript, HTML and CSS with
					a focus on the frameworks React.js, Gatsby, Next.js, Node and Express.
					I use code not only to do my day-to-day job, but also to solve
					everyday problems I come across.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not writing code I love to spend time with my wife and 3
					year old daughter at home in London or travelling around the world. We
					are quite a multi-cultural family with me having grown up in Germany
					ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and my wife being from Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, which is why we raise our
					daughter trilingual. I myself speak five languages (some better than
					others). Furthermore I enjoy cooking fresh food when I come home after
					a long day at the office.
